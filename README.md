Program that calculates the zeros of the function Æ’(x) = 3x2+5x-2.
The program reads from the command line the extremes of the range in which to search for zero and the required precision.
To calculate the zeros, a bisection class has been implemented and a parabola containing the function in which to search for zeros.
